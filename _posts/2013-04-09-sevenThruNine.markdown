April 9th, 2013. Officially we are in week 10 of code school but I wanted
to backtrack and do a blog post of each week I missed since so much has happened.
This is hard to do though, as I'm completely overwhelmed and obsessed with
the NOW. So, what is NOW? Three weeks to go until we officially graduate and I
am nervous. The excitement of learning new things has morphed into wondering
"what can be applied"? I can't escape the thoughts of wondering about what
company I will work for and what my future looks like. But, I will try to
summarize my last few weeks, nonetheless.

In week 7 we focused on Rails, which was fantastic. Going from straight Ruby
 using Sinatra with Rack to Rails was a sort of graduating experience in
itself. Week 8 we looked at Backbone.js and prepared for our job fair. Honestly,
Backbone took a back seat to preparing/updating my portfolio and resume, which
needed a serious rejuvenating. The job fair itself was fantastic, terrifying,
and satisfying - all in one. We got a little over five minutes to speak with
participating possible employers - good practice for the future and a great
chance to meet different companies.

We jumped into Open Source development starting Week 9 and I personally began
a quest to learn how to search GitHub more effectively. While I was learning
how to use GitHub's API I had thoughts of making my own parsing app and
then finally found their Advanced advanced search for "issues". I'm still
pondering whether building a better interface would be beneficial. Anyway,
Open Source in itself is an interesting definition of what is free. Being
new to it all I still feel hesitant to fix "someone else's problem" but am
 learning the style of the community. I also finally made it onto Stack
 Overflow with an answer to a question and a question of my own. Small steps
  to a greater frontier.

And, of course, one of the biggest highlights was being hosted by Crowd Compass.
They were so gracious to provide their space, food, and help - but also
already have a prepared project for us! Holy smokes - we're interns! This
felt really good - we can make something and have it be used by a company.
Awesome.
