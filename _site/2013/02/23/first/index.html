    <p>It has been a bit too long since my last blog post. I merged blogs with Wanderlust and since then have been writing an audio drama, animation, and working too much at a dead end job. BUT SUCCESS! I have quit my job and applied to Portland Code School. After just finishing the first week, I am exhausted and happy – and can feel my brain expanding. Yay learning!</p>

<p>So, I am back on the blog bandwagon though my format has changed. I plan to mix and match some personal observations of my current life with, hopefully, well thought out articles on what I find in the tech world and beyond. What is this code school I speak of?</p>

<p>Portland Code School is a new, immersive program that lasts 12 weeks and currently has 9 students learning to become developers. We all have different backgrounds and skill sets – the commonality being that we all have passion for programming. Chuck is an excellent teacher/facilitator and we both share Evergreen backgrounds, which is comforting.</p>

<p>The first week was a nice loop of intro to retrospective. Being fairly new at using Macs, I spent quite a bit of time setting up the new-to-me MacBook Pro and arguing with the two-finger click. After getting a handle of the basics, the class reviewed HTML and CSS and ended the week with an introduction to Ruby. We’ve been following Treehouse which has mostly videos and quizzes. On my own, I’ve been working through Codecademy to work through problems and typing syntax. Our assignments were challenging and there were many late nights – trying to keep up and catch up to some of the more experienced students. But here it is – one of my assignments is to update my blog. Done and done. Oh, and the other homework will be on github (10 pages HTML) is a ME ME ME sight that I enjoyed styling. I’ll edit/post that when I know the link. Follow me on Twitter - @fayeishere and Github</p>
