    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <p>Alright! Week 4 of code school is complete. It's hard to believe. On one
hand it feels like time flew by and on the other I am amazed at how much
we've accomplished so far. Last week I missed my blog post as I dropped away
from processing and focused on catching up with coding. At the end of Week 4
the class had an exam and a retro. Chuck had us list the important instances of
the course so far. This exercise was pretty empowering - just feeling in command
of the words we wrote.</p>

<p>In week 3 we started on JavaScript which introduced hoisting and shadowing -
both of which are interesting characteristics of the language. We used this
to create a rock, paper, scissors program while pairing. Then we explored
Rack, a helpful server interface for Ruby, and practiced posting data from
a form to a server. GETting it - yay! We had a great tour at Elemental and
was inspired by their team and space. I'd be pretty excited to intern there if I
get the chance. From there we played a bit more with Ruby and touched on
TDD (Test Driven Development) before focusing on the main project of
the week: Making This Blog! We played with Jekyll and GitHub Pages and I went
with Octopress which is awesome. Can't you tell?</p>

<p>Week 4: The hardest thing so far for me is integrating the programming with
the front end application. I'm not sure if this is because my intro to developing
has been with C++ or the constant changing of the web - or both. Week 4 really
put this at the forefront and it seems the curtains have lifted. Now we
started using Sinatra and built a notecard application in Ruby in the REST style.
This was pretty exciting because we were building something that was much
more dynamic. This project became such a flagpole that we continued by using JSON
syntax and Ajax to use our notecard application in a browser. I used Bootstrap to
quickly set up my CSS and JS files which allowed me to focus on fully integrating
the jQuery I just learned to the ruby program we developed. After working on it
for a few days I have the whole thing memorized but more importantly - IT WORKED!
This was the most satisfying success of the program. The imposter syndrome has left
the building. I am coding. Another highlight of the week was the Ruby Nest meetup,
a nice sized group of women hacking with Ruby. I met some good people and got some
great advice. I'm definitely going to go to the next one. One month down. Two
to go. Still excited.
